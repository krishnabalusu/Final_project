# Overview

The purpose of this project was to develop a web application for sales performance analysis using Python and Streamlit. The web app allows users to explore sales data, including total sales, product distribution, sales trends, and customer segmentation. It provides valuable insights into sales patterns and trends, enabling businesses to make informed decisions regarding inventory management, marketing strategies, and market expansion.

## Stakeholder benefit

Stakeholders who would benefit from this tool include business owners, sales managers, and marketing professionals. They would find the tool useful for gaining insights into sales performance, identifying top-selling products and customer segments, and understanding market trends. By using the web app, stakeholders can optimize inventory levels, tailor marketing campaigns, and allocate resources effectively to maximize sales and profitability.

## Data description

The dataset used for this project contains sales data from an online retail store. It includes information such as invoice number, stock code, description, quantity, invoice date, unit price, customer ID, and country. The data was extracted from a CSV file and cleaned to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and format dates.

## Algorithm description

The algorithms driving the web app involve data processing and visualization techniques. Key algorithms include:

Calculation of total sales and sales performance by country.
Grouping and summarization of data for product distribution analysis.
Resampling and aggregation for sales trend analysis.
Segmentation analysis using clustering algorithms.



## Tools used

Python: Programming language used for data analysis, web development, and algorithm implementation.
Streamlit: Web application framework used for building interactive web apps with Python.
Pandas: Data manipulation library used for data cleaning and analysis.
Plotly: Visualization library used for creating interactive charts and graphs.
Scikit-learn: Machine learning library used for segmentation analysis.
GitHub: Version control platform used for storing code and collaborating on development.

#### Ethical concerns 

One ethical concern of this application is the privacy and security of customer data. To mitigate this risk, the application should anonymize or encrypt sensitive information and comply with data protection regulations such as GDPR. Additionally, the application should prioritize transparency and user consent regarding data collection and usage. Ensuring data accuracy and avoiding biased analysis is also crucial to maintain trust and integrity in decision-making processes. Regular audits and updates to the application can help address ethical concerns and ensure responsible use of data.
